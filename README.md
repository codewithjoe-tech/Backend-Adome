SaaS Project Setup Guide
This guide provides instructions to set up and run the SaaS project on your local machine using Docker, Minikube, and Skaffold.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Docker: Containerization platform to build and run the application.
Minikube: Local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing.
Skaffold: Tool for continuous development and deployment.

Installation Steps
1. Install Docker
Docker is required to containerize the application.

Windows/Mac: Download and install Docker Desktop from Docker's official website.
Linux: Follow the official Docker installation guide for your distribution:sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker


Verify installation:docker --version



2. Install Minikube
Minikube sets up a local Kubernetes cluster.

Download and install Minikube:
Windows/Mac/Linux: Follow the instructions on the Minikube official documentation.
Example for Linux:curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube




Start Minikube:minikube start


Verify installation:minikube version



3. Install Skaffold
Skaffold automates the development workflow for Kubernetes applications.

Download and install Skaffold:
Windows/Mac/Linux: Follow the instructions on the Skaffold official website.
Example for Linux:curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-linux-amd64
sudo install skaffold /usr/local/bin/




Verify installation:skaffold version



Running the Project Locally
Once the prerequisites are installed, follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

Clone the Repository (if applicable):
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>


Run the Application with Skaffold:Ensure Minikube is running (minikube start), then execute:
skaffold dev

This command builds the application, deploys it to the local Minikube cluster, and watches for changes to redeploy automatically.

Access the Application:

After skaffold dev starts, it will provide the URL to access the application (typically http://localhost:<port> or a Minikube service URL).
To find the service URL, you can run:minikube service <service-name> --url

Replace <service-name> with the name of your service defined in the Kubernetes manifests.



Troubleshooting

Docker not running: Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker daemon on Linux) is running before starting Minikube.
Minikube issues: Check the Minikube status with minikube status and ensure itâ€™s running.
Skaffold errors: Verify your skaffold.yaml configuration and ensure all required files (e.g., Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests) are present.

Additional Notes

Ensure you have sufficient resources (CPU, memory) allocated to Docker and Minikube.
For detailed logs during development, use the --verbosity=debug flag with skaffold dev.
To stop the application, press Ctrl+C in the terminal running skaffold dev, and stop Minikube with minikube stop.

For further assistance, refer to the official documentation for Docker, Minikube, and Skaffold.
